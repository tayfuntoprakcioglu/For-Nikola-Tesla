# Add simple words
 You can use it in different projects by adding random words with Javascript.

```javascript
tt[0] = "words";
tt[1] = "words";
tt[2] = "words";
.
.
.
```

- Set fixed text for word start and end.
```javascript
document.write("Add word title" + "\"<i>" + tt[index] + "</i>\"\n word ending text");
```

- Add author quote (If you are going to use it in this way. Skip the setting above.)
```javascript
tt[0] = "words - author";
```
